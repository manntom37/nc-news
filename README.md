# NC News - Front End

Welcome to NC News! This app is the Front End project I completed during the Northcoders bootcamp using React and linking to my own API with Axios.

Users can view articles, comment on the articles (as a test user) as well as upvote comments and articles. Users are able to filter news by topic, date, and most popular.

# Using the Repo

To run the project locally, clone the project to your computer and run the following command to install the project's dependencies.

### `npm install`

Once in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will start the application in development mode and will open up http://localhost:3000 to view in the browser!
